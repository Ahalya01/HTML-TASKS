<h3><u>HTML</u></h3>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a web language used to design web pages and arrange a website's layout. Unlike programming languages, HTML is a markup language, so it doesn't produce execution errors. Instead, HTML code is rendered directly by browsers without being compiled or interpreted.</p>
<h3><u>Basic structure of HTML</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>!DOCTYPE</li>
<li>html</li>
<li>head</li>
<li>title</li>
